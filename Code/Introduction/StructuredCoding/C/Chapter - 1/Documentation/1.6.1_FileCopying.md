# 1.6.1 File Copying

Given getchar and putchar, you can write a surprising amount of useful code without knowing anything more about input and output.The simplest example is a program that copies its input to its output one character at a time:

    read a character while (charater is not end-of-file indicator)
        output the character just read
            read a character

Converting this into C gives:

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
/* copy input to output; 1st version */
int main()
{
int c;
c = getchar();

    while (c != EOF) {
        putchar(c);
        c = getchar();
    }
}
```

The relational operator **!=** means **``not equal to''.**
