# 1.5 Symbolic constants

One way to deal with magic numbers is to give them meaningful names. A #define line defines a symbolic name or symbolic constant to be a particular string of characters:

``` C
#define name replacement list
```

Thereafter, any occurrence of name (not in quotes and not part of another name) will be replaced by the corresponding replacement text. The name has the same form as a variable name: a sequence of letters and digits that begins with a letter. The replacement text can be any sequence of characters; it is not limited to numbers.

``` C
#include <stdio.h>
#define LOWER 0 /* lower limit of table */
#define UPPER 300 /* upper limit */
#define STEP 20 /* step size */
/* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */
main()
{
int fahr;
for (fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
}
```
The quantities **LOWER**, **UPPER** and **STEP** are symbolic constants, not variables, so they do not appear in declarations. **Symbolic constant names are conventionally written in upper case** so they can ber readily distinguished from lower case variable names. Notice that there is no semicolon at the end of a **#define** line.
